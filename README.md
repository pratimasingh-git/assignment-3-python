Python Assignment-3 

(a) Differentiate between method overriding and method overloading with an example.

*Method Overriding*

-- Method overriding happens when a child class has a method with the same name and same parameters as the method in the parent class.

-- It is mainly used when we want to change the behavior of a method that we inherit.

*Method Overloading*

-- Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

-- Python does not support real overloading, but we can achieve similar behavior using default values.

(b) Role and Types of Constructors in Python

*Role of Constructor*

-- A constructor is a special method in Python used to initialize the object when it is created.

-- The constructor method in Python is always named __init__().

-- It helps set initial values for object variables.

*Types of Constructors*

1. Default Constructor

-- A constructor that does not take any parameters except self.

2. Parameterized Constructor

-- A constructor that takes parameters to give initial values when the object is created.
